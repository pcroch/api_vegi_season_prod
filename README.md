*This is an API to find the proper vegetables or fruits following the season or the month*. You can find the Api there: https://api-season-prod.herokuapp.com

For the sack of the understanding: I will use the word "item" to describe a fruit or a vegetable.
Actually no one can modify the db as I locked the modification via an Admin... I don't trust the user.
